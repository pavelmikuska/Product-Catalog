# Product Catalog

The application downloads the product catalog from the database and displays a list of all products with selected data to the user. After clicking on a specific product in the list, all data about the product will be displayed in the right part of the window.

The window application is created using JavaFX designed in Scene Builder. Connects to MySQL/MariaDB database.
